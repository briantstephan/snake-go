Bad UI concept that forces you to play snake in your terminal to enter a number. Built using [Termloop](https://github.com/JoelOtter/termloop).

# Instructions

# To do
Please do.
- [ ] Remove leftover score code
- [ ] If focused on entering phone numbers, stop game at 10 digits, and reset the game when the snake "dies"
- [ ] Print string to terminal so it can actually be used
